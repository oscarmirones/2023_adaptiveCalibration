# TRMM adaptive calibration in the South Pacific region.

This repository on GitHub contains the code used to obtain the results presented in the paper titled "Adaptive Calibration Based on Daily Weather Types: Application to TRMM Satellite Product." The provided notebook downloads the necessary dataset and performs the required procedures for adaptive calibration at the Kolopelu station in the French Overseas Collectivity of Wallis and Futuna.

The study was conducted by the Santander Meteorology Group [https://github.com/SantanderMetGroup], with the assistance of the climate4R framework [https://github.com/SantanderMetGroup/climate4R], which was developed by the research group themselves.

The material is also available at https://github.com/SantanderMetGroup/notebooks.
