# TRMM adaptive calibration in the South Pacific region.

This Github repository stores the code on which the results obtained in the paper Adaptive calibration based on daily weather types: application to TRMM satellite product are based. This notebook downloads the required dataset and performs the necessary procedures for an adaptive calibration at the Kolopelu station in the French Overseas Collectivity of Wallis and Futuna. 
This study has been developed at the Santander Meteorology Group [https://github.com/SantanderMetGroup] with the help of the climate4R framework [https://github.com/SantanderMetGroup/climate4R], developed by the research group itself.
